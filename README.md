# Bengaluru-Home-Prices
- Developed a machine learning model using Python and Scikit-learn to accurately predict property prices based on features like location, square footage, and number of bedrooms/bathrooms.
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and outlier removal on a real estate dataset for Bengaluru from Kaggle.

Key Descriptions:
- Processed and analyzed a dataset of 7,251 records and 244 features to help extract insights and build the model.
- Improved model accuracy to 84.5% using linear regression, acheiving consistent cross-validation scores above 80% across 5 iterations.
- Evaluated multiple algorithms (Linear regression, Lasso, Decision tree), using GridSearchCV and identified Linear Regression as the most optimal model with a best score of 0.818.
- Used Matplotlib to visualize key data trends to help assist with decision-makings.
- Utilized a location-based feature selection and paramater tuning to improve predictive accuracy for over 240 unique locations.
